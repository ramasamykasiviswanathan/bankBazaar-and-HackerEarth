/**
 * You are given a string, which contains entirely of decimal digits (0-9). Each
 * digit is made of a certain number of dashes, as shown in the image below. For
 * instance 1 is made of 2 dashes, 8 is made of 7 dashes and so on.
 * 
 * digits made of dashes
 * 
 * You have to write a function that takes this string message as an input and
 * returns a corresponding value in terms of a number. This number is the count
 * of dashes in the string message.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 0 consists of 6 dashes, 1 consists of 2 dashes, 2 consists of 5 dashes, 3
 * consists of 5 dashes, 4 consists of 4 dashes, 5 consists of 5 dashes, 6
 * consists of 6 dashes, 7 consists of 3 dashes [though the figure shows that 7
 * consists of 4 dashes but due to minor mistake in the problem please write
 * your solution assuming 7 consists of 3 dashes], 8 consists of 7 dashes, 9
 * consists of 6 dashes.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * String message will contain at least one digit, but not more than 100 Each
 * character in code will be a digit ('0'-'9').
